Hi!

No, I did not mistakenly misspell the name of this txt file.
Reamde is just a reference to a book written by one of my favorite novelists, "Neal Stephenson".

"Neal Town Stephenson (born October 31, 1959) is an American writer known for his works of speculative fiction.
His novels have been categorized as science fiction, historical fiction, cyberpunk, postcyberpunk, and baroque.
Stephenson's work explores mathematics, cryptography, linguistics, philosophy, currency, and the history of science.
He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as Wired.
He has written novels with his uncle, George Jewsbury ("J. Frederick George"), under the collective pseudonym Stephen Bury.
Stephenson has worked part-time as an advisor for Blue Origin, a company (founded by Jeff Bezos) developing a spacecraft and a space launch system,[1] and is also a cofounder of Subutai Corporation, whose first offering is the interactive fiction project The Mongoliad.
He was Magic Leap's Chief Futurist from 2014 to 2020.[2]" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson

Anyway, this is my first attempt at learning any sort of programming(HTML,CSS, a sprinkle of JS).
So, for my first project, I decided to work on a webpage for a friend who I encouraged to start streaming on Twitch.
It's basically just starting out as a static HTML link page, but we'll see where it goes.
I took a CSS reference sheet from w3-schools (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css) and began to build on top of it, occasionally modifying or creating my own CSS within the HTML <head> without modifying the .css stylesheet (I'm a noob, give me a break).
I've learned a lot from this basic project, and I've also learned that I absolutely love programming.
I'll be putting this in a Github repository and this static page is being hosted @ https://babykins3000.pages.dev.
